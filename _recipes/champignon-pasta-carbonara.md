# Champignon pasta carbonara

One of my favorite dishes, which makes champignons, pepper, and pecorino cheese really shine.

## Ingredients

- 400g Chestnut mushrooms
- 1 Sjallot
- 5 tenen Knoflook
- 1 bunch Parsley
- xg Pecorino cheese
- 200g Linguine pasta
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Steps

1. Start by breaking the champignons in smaller pieces, halves or quarters. Set a pan over pretty high heat with a layer of Olive oil. Once the oil and pan are nice and hot, put in the champignons, stir a bit. Then let it sit on medium-high temperature.
2. Finely dice the Sjallot and Knoflook. Once the Champignons are really smell good and have released their water and the oil back in the pan, add the Sjallot and Knoflook.
3. In a small bowl add 2 egg yolks, 1 whole egg, a good amount of freshly ground black pepper and the finely grated pecorino cheese. Stir well.
4. Meanwhile put the pasta in hot water with a *bunch* of salt.
5. Right before the pasta is finished cooking turn off the heat of the champignon sjallot knoflook mixture. Add the pasta, and make sure to store pasta water. Add a little bit of the hot pasta water to the egg, pepper, cheese mixture while stirring well. This helps to prevent the cheese becoming stringy later. Add the mixture in the pan with the pasta and champignons while stirring well.
6. Keep stirring until everything comes together nicely. If it is to runny you can try turning on the heat on a little bit.
7. Serve with chopped parsley, more grated cheese, freshly ground black pepper and some flaky salt.
